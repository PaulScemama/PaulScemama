In the deterministic approach we try and find a setting of \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) that best agrees with our dataset \\(\\{\\pmb{\\mathsf{x}}, \\pmb{\\mathsf{t}}\\}\\) by minimizing some notion of “error”. This error measures the misfit between a realized model – the function \\(y(x, \\mathbf{w})\\) for a given value of \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) – and the training data points. A widely used (and simple) error function is given by the sum-of-squares of the Euclidean distance between predictions \\(y(x_n, \\mathbf{w})\\) and the corresponding target values \\(t_n\\),\n\\[\nE(\\mathbf{w}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{n=1}^N \\{y(x_n, \\mathbf{w}) - t_n \\}^2. \\tag{3}\n\\]\nThe value of \\(E(\\mathbf{w})\\) is always non-negative and zero only when \\(y(x, \\mathbf{w})\\) passes exactly through every training point.

Because the error function in \\((3)\\) is a quadratic function of the parameters \\(\\mathbf{w}\\), its derivative with respect to \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) will be linear in the elements of \\(\\mathbf{w}\\). Therefore, the minimization of the error function has a unique solution, which we denote \\(\\mathbf{w}^*\\). It can be found in closed form (Appendix 1).

This involves adding a new term to the error function \\((3)\\) that penalizes the parameters \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) for being too large.

    "text": "3.1 The Model\nIn the deterministic approach we assumed \\(t\\) to be the result of a deterministic function of \\(x\\) and unknown parameters \\(\\mathbf{w}\\). We now consider a probabilistic model so that we can express uncertainty in our predictions.\nIn the deterministic approach, we considered \\(t\\) as being the result of a process described by a parameterized function \\(y(x, \\mathbf{w})\\). However, we may not want to make such a strong statement as saying \\(t\\) is exactly equal to \\(y(x, \\mathbf{w})\\). This could be because we think there is noise in the observations \\(\\pmb{\\mathsf{t}}\\), for example due to measurement error. To introduce such uncertainty, we need to place a distribution over the target variable \\(t\\). A sensible distributional assumption is to place a Gaussian distribution over \\(t\\), with its mean given by the parameterized function \\(y(x, \\mathbf{w})\\), and its variance being fixed and unknown. This is visualized in Figure 2.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Illustration of a Gaussian conditional distribution over \\(t\\) conditioned on \\(x\\) where the mean of the distribution is given by some function of \\(x\\), and the variance is fixed\n\n\nTo understand what we’re effectively saying when we create such a model, it is useful to re-emphasize and apply the data-generating process perspective. We can think of our model as describing a process that produces \\(t\\) from a given \\(x\\) and parameter \\(\\mathbf{w}\\). Last section, this process was a deterministic function \\(y(x, \\mathbf{w})\\). In this section, we extend the process by making the assumption that each \\(t\\) is the result of \\(y(x, \\mathbf{w})\\) and some additive uncertainty, where that additive uncertainty takes the form of a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with unknown variance. This is to say that we are assuming, to have gotten a particular instance of \\(t\\):\n\nwe are given an instance of \\(x\\),\nthis instance of \\(x\\) is then used to obtain the output of the parameterized function \\(y(x, \\mathbf{w})\\),\nto which we add a sample from a zero-mean Gaussian with fixed and unknown variance.\n\nThis leads to the following model,\n\\[\\begin{align}\np(t|x, \\mathbf{w}, \\beta) &= y(x, \\mathbf{w}) + \\mathcal{N}(0, \\beta^{-1}) \\notag \\\\\n&= \\mathcal{N}(y(x, \\mathbf{w}), \\beta^{-1}), \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\\] where we’ve used the scaling property of the Gaussian distribution’s mean. \\((5)\\) is an observation model and is more specifically referred to as the Gaussian noise model or a conditional Gaussian model."

As the name suggests, we will search for a setting of \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) and \\(\\beta\\) so that the likelihood of our observed data \\(\\{\\pmb{\\mathsf{t}}\\}\\) is maximized. In other words, we’ve defined a data-generating process, and we want to find the setting of the parameters so that the likelihood of our process having created our observed \\(\\{\\pmb{\\mathsf{t}}\\}\\) is maximized.\nIn order to use maximum likelihood estimation, we need to have a likelihood function. A likelihood function is derived from an observation model. It can be thought of as an observation model being applied to a particular dataset. Assuming the data \\(\\{\\pmb{\\mathsf{t}}\\}\\) were independently sampled from \\((5)\\), the likelihood function is the product of evaluating how consistent the model is with each datapoint \\((t_n, x_n)\\), and is evaluated for a particular setting of \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) and \\(\\beta\\),\n\\[\np(\\pmb{\\mathsf{t}}| \\pmb{\\mathsf{x}}, \\mathbf{w}, \\beta) = \\prod_{n=1}^N \\mathcal{N}(t_n|y(x_n, \\mathbf{w}), \\beta^{-1}). \\tag{6}\n\\]\nEach time we choose a setting for \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) and \\(\\beta\\) and plug them into our model, we are defining a conditional distribution given by \\((5)\\). This conditional distribution may agree with the dataset we have, or it may not. Examples of agreement and disagreement are shown in Figure 3.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A Gaussian noise model shown for a handful of \\(x_i\\), with two different settings for \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) and \\(\\beta\\). On the left is a setting of \\((\\mathbf{w}, \\beta)\\) that induces a model that disagrees with our observed data. On the right is a setting of \\((\\mathbf{w}, \\beta)\\) that induces a model that agrees much better with our observed data. Maximum likelihood looks for a setting of \\((\\mathbf{w}, beta)\\) that best agrees with our observed data.\n\n\nWe now demonstrate how, in practice, we compute the maximum likelihood estimates for \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) and \\(\\beta\\). In this example, it can be done in closed form and amounts to taking the derivative of the likelihood \\((6)\\), setting it equal to zero, and then solving for \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) or \\(\\beta\\). We begin with \\(\\mathbf{w}\\). It is common to instead maximize the log likelihood instead of the likelihood \\((6)\\) for numerical stability and convenience. We can write the log likelihood as\n\\[\n\\text{ln}p(\\pmb{\\mathsf{t}}| \\pmb{\\mathsf{x}}, \\mathbf{w}, \\beta) = - \\frac{\\beta}{2} \\sum_{n=1}^N \\{y(x_n ,\\mathbf{w}) - t_n \\}^2 + \\frac{N}{2} \\text{ln}\\beta - \\frac{N}{2} \\text{ln}(2 \\pi). \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\n3.2.1 Maximum Likelihood’s connection to Least-Squares\nIn taking the derivative of \\((7)\\) with respect to \\(\\mathbf{w}\\), we can omit the last two terms as they do not depend on \\(\\mathbf{w}\\). We can also replace the coefficient \\(\\frac{\\beta}{2}\\) with \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) since scaling \\((7)\\) by a constant won’t change the location of the maximum of \\((7)\\) with respect to \\(\\mathbf{w}\\). Lastly, we can equivalently minimize the negative log likelihood. This leaves us with minimizing\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{n=1}^N \\{y(x_n, \\mathbf{w}) - t_n \\}^2. \\tag{8}\n\\]\nAnd so we see that the sum-of-squares error function has arisen as a consequence of maximizing the likelihood under the assumption of a Gaussian noise distribution. In fact, for a Gaussian noise model, maximum likelihood estimation and least-squares estimation find the same \\(\\mathbf{w}\\); in particular, the one that minimizes \\((8)\\). Once we’ve found the maximum likelihood estimate for \\(\\mathbf{w}\\), which we will denote \\(\\mathbf{w}_{\\text{ML}}\\), we can use it to find the setting for the precision parameter \\(\\beta\\) of the Gaussian conditional distribution. Maximizing \\((7)\\) with respect to \\(\\beta\\) yields\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\beta_{\\text{ML}}} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^N \\{y(x_n, \\mathbf{w}_{\\text{ML}}) - t_n \\}^2. \\tag{9}\n\\]\nAnd so we see that the maximum likelihood procedure yields a variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) being the average squared deviation between the observed data points and the fitted \\(y(x, \\mathbf{w}_{\\text{ML}})\\).\n\n\n3.2.2 Maximum Likelihood’s predictive distribution\nThe predictive distribution as a result of the maximum likelihood approach amounts to plugging in the maximum likelihood estimates \\(\\mathbf{w}_{\\text{ML}}\\) and \\(\\beta_{\\text{ML}}\\) into the observation model \\((5)\\):\n\\[\np(t|x, \\mathbf{w}_{\\text{ML}}, \\beta_{\\text{ML}}) = \\mathcal{N}(y(x, \\mathbf{w}_{\\text{ML}}), \\beta^{-1}_{\\text{ML}}). \\tag{10}\n\\]"

    "text": "3.3 Maximum a posteriori Estimation\nIntroducing a prior distribution over the parameters \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) is a way of introducing our prior beliefs (perhaps through domain expertise) about the parameters before observing our dataset. Additionally, as we will see, it serves as a regularizer for our estimate of \\(\\mathbf{w}\\). Importantly, it is also one of the components in Bayes’ theorem, and takes us a step towards a full Bayesian treatment. For simplicity, we introduce a simple Gaussian prior\n\\[\np(\\mathbf{w}| \\alpha) = \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{w} | \\mathbf{0}, \\alpha^{-1} \\mathbf{I}) = \\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{2 \\pi} \\right)^{(M+1) / 2} \\text{exp} \\left[- \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\mathbf{w}^{\\intercal} \\mathbf{w} \\right], \\tag{11}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) is the precision of the distribution and \\(M+1\\) is the number of elements in \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) for an \\(M\\) order polynomial function. Variables such as \\(\\alpha\\) are called hyperparameters since we have to choose them. Now that we have a prior, we can use Bayes’ theorem to yield a quantity proportional to the posterior,\n\\[\n\\overbrace{ p(\\mathbf{w}|\\pmb{\\mathsf{x}}, \\pmb{\\mathsf{t}}, \\alpha, \\beta) }^{\\text{Posterior } p(\\mathbf{w}|D)} \\propto \\underbrace{p(\\pmb{\\mathsf{t}}|\\pmb{\\mathsf{x}}, \\mathbf{w}, \\beta)}_{\\text{Likelihood } p(D|\\mathbf{w})} \\overbrace{p(\\mathbf{w}|\\alpha)}^{\\text{Prior }p(\\mathbf{w})}, \\tag{12}\n\\]\nwhere the proportion relation \\(\\propto\\) comes from the fact that the denominator of Bayes’ theorem, \\(p(D) = p(\\mathbf{t} | \\mathbf{x})\\), does not depend on \\(\\mathbf{w}\\). Maximizing the right hand size of \\((12)\\) with respect to \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) is equivalent to maximizing the posterior with respect to \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) due to the proportionality. By optimizing \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) to maximize the posterior, we are finding the most probable parameter values \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) considering our observed data and also our prior knowledge about \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) encapsulated in the (data independent) prior \\(p(\\mathbf{w} | \\alpha)\\). This yields a tradeoff between what we believed about \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) before seeing our data, and the \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) that best fits our data. This technique is referred to maximum a posteriori estimation, MAPE, or MAP.\n\n3.3.1 Maximum a posteriori’s connection to Least-Squares\nTaking the negative logarithm of \\((12)\\) and combining with the log likelihood in \\((7)\\) and the prior in \\((11)\\), it can be shown that the maximum of the posterior is equivalenty the minimum of the following expression:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\beta}{2} \\sum_{n=1}^N \\{y(x_n, \\mathbf{w}) - t_n \\}^2 + \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\mathbf{w}^\\intercal \\mathbf{w}. \\tag{13}\n\\]\nIf we define \\(\\lambda = \\alpha / \\beta\\), we can rewrite \\((13)\\) as\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{n=1}^N \\{y(x_n, \\mathbf{w}) - t_n \\}^2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\mathbf{w}^\\intercal \\mathbf{w}. \\tag{14}\n\\]\nAnd so we see that minimizing the regularized sum-of-squares function introduced in \\((4)\\) arises naturally from maximizing the posterior of a Gaussian noise model with Gaussian prior.\n\n\n3.3.2 Maximum a posteriori’s predictive distribution\nSimilar to Maximum Likelihood, the result of the maximum a posteriori estimation method are point-estimates for the parameters \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) and \\(\\beta\\).

    "text": "3.4 Bayesian Estimation\nSo far we have been making a point estimate of \\(\\mathbf{w}\\), which does not yet amount to a Bayesin treatment. In a Bayesian treatment, we take into account all possible \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) that could have explained our data. To predict a new value of \\(t\\) for a new \\(x\\), we marginalize over all possible settings of \\(\\mathbf{w}\\), yielding the posterior predictive distribution or Bayesian model average. The goal of the Bayesian treatment is to compute the posterior over the weights \\(p(\\mathbf{w}|D)\\) which represents all possible settings of \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) given our observed data \\(D\\). To this end, we must use Bayes’ theorem:\n\\[\np(\\mathbf{w}|D) = \\frac{p(D|\\mathbf{w})(p(\\mathbf{w}))}{p(D)}. \\tag{16}\n\\]\nAnd for our regression problem in particular, \\((16)\\) can be further specified as\n\\[\np(\\mathbf{w}|\\pmb{\\mathsf{t}}, \\pmb{\\mathsf{x}}, \\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{\\overbrace{p(\\pmb{\\mathsf{t}} | \\pmb{\\mathsf{x}}, \\mathbf{w}, \\beta)}^{\\text{Likelihood}} \\cdot \\overbrace{p(\\mathbf{w} | \\alpha)}^{\\text{Prior}}}{\\underbrace{p(\\pmb{\\mathsf{t}} | \\pmb{\\mathsf{x}})}_{\\text{Evidence}}}.\n\\tag{17}\n\\]\nTo simplify this, we will assume the parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are fixed and known in advance, and we will solely focus on the unknown \\(\\mathbf{w}\\). \\((16)\\) then turns into\n\\[\np(\\mathbf{w} \\vert \\pmb{\\mathsf{x}}, \\pmb{\\mathsf{t}}) = \\frac{p(\\pmb{\\mathsf{t}} \\vert \\pmb{\\mathsf{x}}, \\mathbf{w}) \\cdot p(\\mathbf{w})}{p(\\pmb{\\mathsf{t}} \\vert \\pmb{\\mathsf{x}})}. \\tag{18}\n\\]\nSo instead of computing a single point estimate of the weights (as we’ve done thus far); now, given the likelihood and the prior, we can compute the posterior distribution over \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) via Bayes’ rule. Computing the posterior can be facilitated by our choice of prior (a modeling choice) so that we can calculate the posterior in closed form. Those priors are referred to as conjugate priors. There are a number of other techniques used to instead approximate the posterior \\(p(\\mathbf{w}|\\pmb{\\mathsf{t}}, \\pmb{\\mathsf{x}})\\) when conjugacy is impossible. These include variational inference and markov chain monte carlo sampling. We save all these methods for another post and assume we’ve found the exact posterior.\n\n3.4.1 Bayesian’s predictive distribution\nOnce it is found, the posterior represents all possible settings of \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) that could explain our data. To incorporate this information into a predictive distribution so that we can predict new values of an unobserved \\(t\\) given an unobserved \\(x\\), we marginalize over all possible settings of \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) like so:\n\\[\np(t|x, \\pmb{\\mathsf{x}}, \\pmb{\\mathsf{t}}) = \\int p(t|x, \\mathbf{w}) p(\\mathbf{w}|\\pmb{\\mathsf{x}}, \\pmb{\\mathsf{t}}) \\text{d}\\mathbf{w}, \\tag{19}\n\\]\nwhere \\(p(t|x, \\mathbf{w})\\) is our model given by \\((5)\\) omitting the dependence on \\(\\beta\\), and \\(p(\\mathbf{w}|\\pmb{\\mathsf{x}}, \\pmb{\\mathsf{t}})\\) is the posterior over the weights \\(\\mathbf{w}\\). In \\((19)\\),\n\nwe look at a possible setting of \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) which we will denote \\(\\mathbf{w}_i\\) according to the posterior \\(p(\\mathbf{w}|\\pmb{\\mathsf{x}}, \\pmb{\\mathsf{t}})\\). Placing \\(\\mathbf{w}_i\\) into our observation model \\(p(t|x, \\mathbf{w})\\) defines a “fitted model” \\(p(t|x, \\mathbf{w}_i)\\).\nthis “fitted” model is multiplied by the probability of that setting of \\(\\mathbf{w}_i\\) given by the posterior. In other words, the probability that \\(p(t|x, \\mathbf{w}_i)\\) having been used to generate our observed data \\(\\pmb{\\mathsf{t}}\\) from the inputs \\(\\pmb{\\mathsf{x}}\\).\nwe do this for every possible setting \\(\\mathbf{w}_i\\) according to the posterior and integrate.\n\nThus, we are taking a weighted average of all possible “fitted” models, where the weights of each component are determined by how likely the setting of \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) isi according to its posterior.\n\n\n3.4.2 Analyzing our specific predictive distribution\nWe will now alnalyze the specific form of \\((19)\\) for our example problem. A consequence of us selecting a Gaussian likelihood and a Gaussian prior is that we can analytically compute the posterior; and it is Gaussian as well – an example of conjugacy. More so, we can analytically solve the integration in \\((19)\\) to get a predictive distribution that itself is Gaussian. In fact, it takes on the more specific form\n\\[\np(t|x, \\pmb{\\mathsf{x}}, \\pmb{\\mathsf{t}}) = \\mathcal{N}(t|m(x), s^2(x)), \\tag{20}\n\\]\nwhere the mean and variance are given by\n\\[\\begin{align}\n&m(x) = \\beta \\pmb{\\phi}(x)^{\\intercal} \\mathbf{S} \\sum_{n=1}^N \\pmb{\\phi}(x_n) t_n \\tag{19} \\\\\n& s^2(x) = \\overbrace{\\beta^{-1}}^{\\text{noise}} + \\underbrace{\\pmb{\\phi}(x)^\\intercal \\mathbf{S} \\pmb{\\phi}(x)}_{\\text{Parameter Uncertainty}} \\tag{20}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) is a matrix, and is given by\n\\[\n\\mathbf{S}^{-1} = \\alpha \\mathbf{I} + \\beta \\sum_{n=1}^N \\pmb{\\phi}(x_n)  \\pmb{\\phi}(x),^\\intercal \\tag{21}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) is the unit matrix, and we have defined the vector \\(\\pmb{\\phi}(x)\\) with elements \\(\\phi_i(x) = x^i\\) for \\(i=0,...,M\\). In the predictive distribution \\((20)\\), we now see that the variance depends on \\(x\\). It’s expansion is described by \\((21)\\) and it contains two additive components. The first component, as was already expressed in the maximum likelihood predictive distribution \\(\\beta_{\\text{ML}}\\), is the noise on the target variables. The second component, which has not been expressed until now, arises from the uncertainty in the parameters \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) and is a consequence of treating \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) as a random variable – a mainstay of the Bayesian treatment."
